If you wish to ask a question on the forum, you will need to click the "Sign Up Now!" link to create an account and login using that account.

When asking a question on the forum, it is important that you:

* First check to see if the question has already been asked. If you find a similar question, do not create a new thread. Instead use the "Reply" link
  at the bottom of the post to add your comments to the existing thread.

* Review the available categories to see which one is most closely related to your question. Click on that category and use the "Post New Thread"
  button to open the editor. After typing your post and before you click the "Create Thread" button, make sure the "Watch this thread..." box is
  checked. If you want to be notified by email, also check the "and receive email notifications" box. That way you will be notified whenever anyone
  answers your question.

.. _IRC:

IRC
---

If you wish to ask a question in real time, you can try the *#freenas* channel on IRC
`Freenode <http://freenode.net/index.shtml>`_. Depending upon the time of day and your time zone, a FreeNAS® developer or other FreeNAS® users may be
available to assist you. If you do not get an answer right away, remain on the channel as other users tend to read the channel history in order to answer
questions as they are able to.

Typically, an IRC
`client <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Internet_Relay_Chat_clients>`_
is used to access the *#freenas* IRC channel. Alternately, you can access the
`webchat <http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=freenas>`_
version of the channel from a web browser.

To get the most out of the IRC channel, keep the following points in mind:

* Do not ask "can anyone help me?"; instead, just ask your question. If someone knows the answer, they will try to assist you.

* Do not ask a question and then leave. Users who know the answer can not help you if you disappear.

* Do not take it personally if no one answers or demand that someone answers your question. Maybe no one who knows the answer is available, maybe your
  question is really hard, or maybe it is a question that has already been answered many times in the other support resources. Try asking again in a few
  hours or research the other resources to see if you have missed anything.

* Do not post error messages in the channel as the IRC software will probably kick you out. Instead, use a pasting service such as
  `pastebin <http://www.pastebin.com/>`_
  and paste the resulting URL into the IRC discussion.

.. _Mailing Lists:

Mailing Lists
-------------

Several FreeNAS® mailing lists are available which allow users and developers to ask and answer questions related to the topic of the mailing list. To post
an email to a list, you will need to subscribe to it first. Each mailing list is archived, allowing you to browse for information by date, thread name, or
author.

The following mailing lists are available:

* `Freenas-announce <http://lists.freenas.org/mailman/listinfo/freenas-announce>`_: this is a low-volume, read-only list where major milestones, such as new
  releases, are announced.

* `Freenas-commit <http://lists.freenas.org/mailman/listinfo/freenas-commit>`_: this is a read-only list. As code changes in the FreeNAS® repository, the
  commit message is automatically sent to this list.

* `Freenas-devel <http://lists.freenas.org/mailman/listinfo/freenas-devel>`_: FreeNAS® developers are subscribed to this list. Technical questions about the
  current FreeNAS® release can be posted here.

* `Freenas-docs <http://lists.freenas.org/mailman/listinfo/freenas-docs>`_: this list is for discussion regarding
  `FreeNAS® documentation <http://doc.freenas.org/>`_.

* `Freenas-testing <http://lists.freenas.org/mailman/listinfo/freenas-testing>`_: FreeNAS® developers are subscribed to this list. Technical questions about
  the upcoming FreeNAS® release and feedback on testing snapshots can be posted here.

* `Freenas-translations <http://lists.freenas.org/mailman/listinfo/freenas-translations>`_: this list is for discussion regarding
  `FreeNAS® localization <http://pootle.freenas.org/>`_
  and translating FreeNAS® documentation.

.. note:: the mailing lists were migrated from SourceForge to Mailman in December, 2013. Archives of the SourceForge mailing lists are available at
   `Gmane <http://dir.gmane.org/index.php?prefix=gmane.os.freenas>`_.
