Alert
=====

FreeNASÂ® provides an alert system to provide a visual warning of any conditions that require administrative attention. The "Alert" button in the far right
corner will flash red when there is an outstanding alert. In the example alert shown in Figure 21a. one of the disks in a ZFS pool is offline which has
degraded the state of the pool.

**Figure 21a: Example Alert Message**

|Figure21a_png|

Informational messages will have a green OK while messages requiring attention will be listed as a red CRITICAL. CRITICAL messages will also be emailed to the
root user account. If you are aware of a critical condition but wish to remove the flashing alert until you deal with it, uncheck the box next to that
message.

Behind the scenes, an alert script checks for various alert conditions, such as volume and disk status, and writes the current conditions to */var/tmp/alert*.
A javascript retrieves the current alert status every 5 minutes and will change the solid green alert icon to flashing red if a new alert is detected. Some of
the conditions that trigger an alert include:

* a ZFS volume's capacity goes over 80%

* non-optimal multipath states

* UPS ONBATT/LOWBATT event

* ZFS pool status changes from HEALTHY

* the system is unable to bind to the WebGUI Address set in :menuselection:`System --> General`

* the system can not find an IP address configured on an iSCSI portal

* the status of a LSI MegaRAID SAS controller has changed;
  `mfiutil(8) <http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=mfiutil>`_
  is included for managing these devices

An alert will also be generated when the LSI HBA firmware version does not match the driver version. To resolve this alert, download the IT (integrated
target) firmware, not the IR (integrated RAID) firmware, from the LSI website. Then, specify the name of the firmware image and bios as well as the
controller to flash::

 sas2flash -f firmwareimagename -v biosname -c controllernumber

When finished, reboot the system. The new firmware version should appear in the system messages and the alert will be cleared.
