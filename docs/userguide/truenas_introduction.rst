Introduction
------------

Welcome to the TrueNAS® Administrator Guide. This Guide provides information about configuring and managing the TrueNAS® Unified Storage Appliance. Your
iXsystems support engineer will assist with the appliance's initial setup and configuration. Once you are familiar with the configuration workflow, this
document can be used as a reference guide to the many features provided by TrueNAS®.

How This Guide is Organized
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The information in the TrueNAS® Administrator Guide has been organized as follows:

* Chapter 1: Introduction: describes the organization of the guide and the typographic conventions.

* Chapter 2: ZFS Overview: many of the features in the TrueNAS® Storage Appliance rely on the ZFS file system. An overview is provided to familiarize the
  administrator with the terminology and features provided by ZFS.

* Chapter 3: Accessing TrueNAS®: this chapter introduces the console, demonstrates how to activate the TrueNAS® license, and shows how to access the
  graphical administrative interface.

* Chapter 4: Quick Start: this chapter provides an overview of the configuration workflow.

* Chapters 5-12: these chapters cover the configuration options which are available in the TrueNAS® graphical administrative interface. The chapter order
  reflects the order that the configuration options appear within the administrative interface's tree structure. Chapter 5 describes how to create users and
  groups. Chapter 6 describes the tasks that can be accomplished using the System Configuration section of the administrative interface. Chapter 7
  demonstrates the various network configuration options. Chapter 8 deals with storage: how to manage storage volumes, snapshots, and replication. Chapter 9
  provides examples for creating AFP, CIFS, and NFS shares. Chapter 10 describes how to configure and start/stop the built-in services. Chapter 11 provides an
  overview of the Reporting mechanism. Chapter 12 covers the remaining configuration options that appear below the interface's tree structure or which appear
  as icons in the upper right portion of the interface.

* Chapter 13: Upgrading TrueNAS®: this chapter demonstrates how to upgrade the TrueNAS® operating system to a newer version.

* Chapter 14: Using the FreeNAS API: this chapter demonstrates how to use the FreeNAS® API to remotely control a TrueNAS® system.

**Typographic Conventions**

The TrueNAS® Administrator Guide uses the following typographic conventions:

* Names of graphical elements such as buttons, icons, fields, columns, and boxes are enclosed within quotes. For example: click the "Performance Test" button.

* Menu selections are italicized and separated by arrows. For example: :menuselection:`System --> Information`.

* Commands that are mentioned within text are highlighted in :command:`bold text`. Command examples and command output are contained in green code blocks.

* Volume, dataset, and file names are enclosed in a blue box :file:`/like/this`.

* Keystrokes are formatted in a blue box. For example: press :kbd:`Enter`.

* **bold text:** used to emphasize an important point.

* *italic text:* used to represent device names or text that is input into a GUI field.
