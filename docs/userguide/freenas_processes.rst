Display System Processes
========================

If you click "Display System Processes", a screen will open showing the output of
`top(1) <http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=top>`_. An example is shown in Figure 15a.

The display will automatically refresh itself. Simply click the "X" in the upper right corner to close the display when you are finished. Note that the display
is read-only, meaning that you won't be able to issue a :command:`kill` command within it.
